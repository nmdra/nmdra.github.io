### 1. **Donâ€™t feed the trolls.** 
  Seriously, they thrive on attention. Save your energy for better things.[^1]  
  If someone replies to a troll, they end up becoming a troll themselves.
  > "Youâ€™re going to see a lot of stupid stuff out there and youâ€™re going to feel like you need to correct it. One time I was up late on my laptop and my wife yelled at me, 'Quit picking fights on Twitter and go make something.'" â€“ *Austin Kleon, Keep Going*
### 2. **Ditch the apps.** 
  Uninstall those time-suckers from your phone (or whatever device you canâ€™t put down).**Go old schoolâ€”use the web.** And donâ€™t forget an ad-blocker to keep distractions at bay.  
### 3. **Kill the notifications.** 
  No buzz, no ding, no stress. Freedom feels amazing.  
### 4. **Say no Short Videos.** 
  Short videos might be fun, but theyâ€™re stealing your time.  
### 5. **Social media â‰  news.** 
  Itâ€™s full of misinformation. Stick to proper news sitesâ€”even if theyâ€™re biased, at least you can pick the bias you prefer!  
### 6. **Celebs and influencers? Meh.** 
  Theyâ€™re here for business, not you. Stop wasting time on them. Unfollow and focus on your own life!  
### 7. **Use incognito mode.** 
  It makes you log in every time you close a tabâ€”an extra step that makes social media less tempting.
  > "The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don't even have the option to act." â€“ *James Clear, Atomic Habits*
### 8. **Do something awesome instead.** 
  Read that book youâ€™ve been meaning to start, learn something new, or pick up a hobby you love.  
### 9. **Contact family the old-fashioned way.** 
  Instead of chatting on social media, reach out directly to your family. Nothing beats real, personal connections.
