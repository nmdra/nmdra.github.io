Redis is a high-performance in-memory data store, widely used as a database, cache, and message broker. Unlike many web services that use HTTP, Redis uses a custom protocol known as the **Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP)** for communication between clients and servers.

In this article, we’ll explore RESP, how it compares to HTTP, and what makes it ideal for Redis’s design philosophy.

## What is RESP?

RESP, or **Redis Serialization Protocol**, is the **wire protocol** used by Redis clients (including `redis-cli`) to communicate with the Redis server. It defines the way data is serialized and transmitted over the network.

> A **wire protocol** is the formal specification of how data is formatted and exchanged between two systems over a network connection.

RESP is lightweight, efficient, and designed specifically for Redis — but it can be reused in any client-server software.

## RESP vs HTTP

Redis does **not** use HTTP. Instead, it defines its own set of commands and responses via RESP. Here’s how RESP equivalents map to typical HTTP operations:

| **HTTP Feature**       | **Redis Equivalent**                             |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `GET /resource`        | `GET key`                                        |
| `POST /resource`       | `SET key value`                                  |
| `PUT /resource`        | `SET key value`, or `HSET`, `JSON.SET` (module)  |
| `DELETE /resource`     | `DEL key`                                        |
| `200 OK`               | `+OK`                                            |
| `404 Not Found`        | `(nil)`                                          |
| `500 Internal Error`   | `-ERR <message>`                                 |
| `403 Forbidden`        | `-NOAUTH Authentication required.`               |

Unlike HTTP, RESP is not based on request methods or status codes. Instead, Redis commands and responses follow a minimal and efficient format optimized for performance.

## RESP Characteristics

| Feature                    | Description                                                                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Text-based**             | Commands and responses are human-readable (but binary-safe for values).                |
| **Persistent TCP**         | Communication happens over a persistent TCP connection (default port: `6379`).         |
| **Request/Response Model** | Clients issue commands (e.g. `SET key value`) and Redis replies with a response.       |

RESP works over **TCP or Unix sockets**, not HTTP. You can even **telnet** into Redis and type RESP commands manually.

## RESP Data Types

RESP supports the following basic data types:

| **Type**        | **Prefix** | **Description**                                             |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Simple String   | `+`        | Usually used for status replies.                            |
| Error           | `-`        | Used to signal errors.                                      |
| Integer         | `:`        | Used to return numeric values (e.g. result of `INCR`).      |
| Bulk String     | `$`        | String with specified length, can include binary-safe data. |
| Null Bulk       | `$-1`      | Used to represent a null value.                             |
| Array           | `*`        | List of other RESP types.                                   |
| Null Array      | `*-1`      | Used to represent a null array (RESP3).                     |
| Map (RESP3)     | `%`        | Key-value pairs (available in RESP3).                       |
| Set (RESP3)     | `~`        | Unordered collection of unique elements (RESP3).            |
| Boolean (RESP3) | `#`        | `true` or `false` in RESP3.                                 |
| Double (RESP3)  | `,`        | Floating point number in RESP3.                             |

## Security in RESP

Security in RESP is **minimal by default**, because Redis was designed for **trusted local environments**. Here’s what that means:

- RESP is **plaintext**, meaning commands and data are sent unencrypted.
- Optional password authentication via `requirepass`.
- No user roles (before Redis 6).
- Redis will accept any client connection if the port is reachable.
- From Redis 6 onward, **SSL/TLS** support is available (needs to be compiled in), enabling **encrypted RESP communication** over TLS — just like HTTPS vs HTTP.

## RESP Versions

| Version   | Introduced In | Features                                                                 |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **RESP2** | Redis 2.x     | Basic protocol used by most clients today. Fast and text-based.          |
| **RESP3** | Redis 6.0     | Supports richer data types, attribute metadata, and **introspection**.   |

> **Introspection** in RESP3 allows clients to query metadata about the server or connection, improving diagnostics and tooling.

## Summary

Redis’s RESP protocol is a prime example of designing a protocol specifically for performance, simplicity, and predictability. While it lacks the verbosity and feature set of HTTP, it excels in its intended domain — powering fast, efficient key-value operations over a lightweight protocol.
